This Markov's Decision Process and Reinforcement Learning Course Project
# Chess Automation using MDP, RL, Dynamic Programming, and ML

This repository contains the code for automating the game of Chess using Markov Decision Process (MDP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Dynamic Programming, and Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent Chess-playing agent that can make optimal moves based on the current state of the game. We will be using MDP to model the game of Chess, RL algorithms to learn the optimal policy, Dynamic Programming to solve the MDP, and ML techniques to improve the agent's performance.
